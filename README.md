# MyToken Smart Contract Project

This repository contains a project for developing, testing, and deploying a smart contract using the Hardhat framework, tailored for the Rootstock network. The project follows a step-by-step approach, each represented by a specific commit in the repository.

For detailed steps, see the [getting started guide](https://dev.rootstock.io/guides/quickstart/hardhat/)

## What You Will Learn

By following the guide, you will learn:

- How to set up a Hardhat project and configure it for the Rootstock network
- How to create, compile, test, and deploy a simple ERC20 token contract using Hardhat and OpenZeppelin
- How to interact with your deployed contract using Remix and MetaMask
- How to connect your smart contract with a web front-end using ethers.js
- How to debug and troubleshoot common issues in Web3 development
- How to use various tools and libraries to enhance your Web3 development experience
